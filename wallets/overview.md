# Overview

## Wallets

The Beldex wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys, secure or mine Beldex, and trade peer-to-peer.&#x20;

Beldex wallets store a collection of public and private keys which can be used to receive, view, or spend Beldex.&#x20;

The wallet uses the private keys through a daemon which synchronises with the Beldex Network to scan for incoming transactions and to send outgoing transactions.
